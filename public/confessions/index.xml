        &lt;h3&gt;The Principal Question in This Controversy.&lt;span class=&#34;hx:absolute hx:-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;the-principal-question-in-this-controversy&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#the-principal-question-in-this-controversy&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether original sin is properly and without any distinction man&amp;rsquo;s corrupt nature, substance, and essence, or at any rate the principal and best part of his essence [substance], namely, the rational soul itself in its highest state and powers; or whether, even after the Fall, there is a distinction between man&amp;rsquo;s substance, nature, essence, body, soul, and original sin, so that the nature [itself] is one thing, and original sin, which inheres in the corrupt nature and corrupts the nature, another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Affirmative Theses&lt;span class=&#34;hx:absolute hx:-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;affirmative-theses&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#affirmative-theses&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;text-xl&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pure Doctrine, Faith, and Confession according to the Aforesaid Standard and Summary Declaration.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe, teach, and confess that there is a distinction between man&amp;rsquo;s nature, not only as he was originally created by God pure and holy and without sin, but also as we have it [that nature] now after the Fall, namely, between the nature [itself], which even after the Fall is and remains a creature of God, and original sin, and that this distinction is as great as the distinction between a work of God and a work of the devil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe, teach, and confess also that this distinction should be maintained with the greatest care, because this doctrine, that no distinction is to be made between our corrupt human nature and original sin, conflicts with the chief articles of our Christian faith concerning creation, redemption, sanctification, and the resurrection of our body, and cannot coexist therewith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For God created not only the body and soul of Adam and Eve before the Fall, but also our bodies and souls after the Fall, notwithstanding that they are corrupt, which God also still acknowledges as His work, as it is written Job 10:8: Thine hands have made me and fashioned me together round about. Deut. 32:18; Is. 45:9ff; 54:5; 64:8; Acts 17:28; Job 10:8; Ps. 100:3; 139:14; Eccl. 12:1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the Son of God has assumed this human nature, however, without sin, and therefore not a foreign, but our own flesh, into the unity of His person, and according to it is become our true Brother. Heb. 2:14: Forasmuch, then, as the children were partakers of flesh and blood, He also Himself likewise took part of the same. Again, 16; 4:15: He took not on Him the nature of angels, but He took on Him the seed of Abraham. Wherefore in all things it behooved Him to be made like unto His brethren, yet without sin.  In like manner Christ has also redeemed it as His work, sanctifies it as His work, raises it from the dead, and gloriously adorns it as His work. But original sin He has not created, assumed, redeemed, sanctified; nor will He raise it, will neither adorn nor save it in the elect, but in the [blessed] resurrection it will be entirely destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hence the distinction between the corrupt nature and the corruption which infects the nature and by which the nature became corrupt, can easily be discerned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;3&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But, on the other hand, we believe, teach, and confess that original sin is not a slight, but so deep a corruption of human nature that nothing healthy or uncorrupt has remained in man&amp;rsquo;s body or soul, in his inner or outward powers, but, as the Church sings:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through Adam&amp;rsquo;s fall is all corrupt,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nature and essence human.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This damage is unspeakable, and cannot be discerned by reason, but only from God&amp;rsquo;s Word.  And [we affirm] that no one but God alone can separate from one another the nature and this corruption of the nature, which will fully come to pass through death, in the [blessed] resurrection, where our nature which we now bear will rise and live eternally without original sin and separated and sundered from it, as it is written Job 19:26: I shall be compassed again with this my skin, and in my flesh shall I see God, whom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes shall behold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Negative Theses&lt;span class=&#34;hx:absolute hx:-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;negative-theses&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#negative-theses&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;text-xl&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rejection of the False Opposite Dogmas.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore we reject and condemn the teaching that original sin is only a reatus or debt on account of what has been committed by another [diverted to us] without any corruption of our nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, that evil lusts are not sin, but con-created, essential properties of the nature, or, as though the above-mentioned defect and damage were not truly sin, because of which man without Christ [not ingrafted into Christ] would be a child of wrath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We likewise reject the Pelagian error, by which it is alleged that man&amp;rsquo;s nature even after the Fall is incorrupt, and especially with respect to spiritual things has remained entirely good and pure in naturalibus, i. e., in its natural powers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, that original sin is only a slight, insignificant spot on the outside, dashed upon the nature, or a blemish that has been blown upon it, beneath which [nevertheless] the nature has retained its good powers even in spiritual things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, that original sin is only an external impediment to the good spiritual powers, and not a despoliation or want of the same, as when a magnet is smeared with garlic-juice, its natural power is not thereby removed, but only impeded; or that this stain can be easily wiped away like a spot from the face or pigment from the wall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, that in man the human nature and essence are not entirely corrupt, but that man still has something good in him, even in spiritual things, namely, capacity, skill, aptness, or ability in spiritual things to begin, to work, or to help working for something [good].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, we also reject the false dogma of the Manicheans, when it is taught that original sin, as something essential and self-subsisting, has been infused by Satan into the nature, and intermingled with it, as poison and wine are mixed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, that not the natural man, but something else and extraneous to man, sins, on account of which not the nature, but only original sin in the nature, is accused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We reject and condemn also as a Manichean error the doctrine that original sin is properly and without any distinction the substance, nature, and essence itself of the corrupt man, so that a distinction between the corrupt nature, as such, after the Fall and original sin should not even be conceived of, nor that they could be distinguished from one another [even] in thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, this original sin is called by Dr. Luther nature-sin, person-sin, essential sin, not because the nature, person, or essence of man is, without any distinction, itself original sin, but in order to indicate by such words the distinction between original sin, which inheres in human nature, and other sins, which are called actual sins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For original sin is not a sin which is committed, but it inheres in the nature, substance, and essence of man, so that, though no wicked thought ever should arise in the heart of corrupt man, no idle word were spoken, no wicked deed were done, yet the nature is nevertheless corrupted through original sin, which is born in us by reason of the sinful seed, and is a fountainhead of all other actual sins, as wicked thoughts, words, and works, as it is written Matt. 15:19: Out of the heart proceed evil thoughts. Also Gen. 6:5; 8:21: The imagination of man&amp;rsquo;s heart is evil from his youth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus there is also to be noted well the diverse signification of the word nature, whereby the Manicheans cover their error and lead astray many simple men. For sometimes it means the essence [the very substance] of man, as when it is said: God created human nature. But at other times it means the disposition and the vicious quality [disposition, condition, defect, or vice] of a thing, which inheres in the nature or essence, as when it is said: The nature of the serpent is to bite, and the nature and disposition of man is to sin, and is sin; here the word nature does not mean the substance of man, but something that inheres in the nature or substance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as to the Latin terms &lt;em&gt;substantia&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;accidens&lt;/em&gt;, because they are not words of Holy Scripture, and besides unknown to the ordinary man, they should not be used in sermons before ordinary, uninstructed people, but simple people should be spared them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in the schools, among the learned, these words are rightly retained in disputations concerning original sin, because they are well known and used without any misunderstanding, to distinguish exactly between the essence of a thing and what attaches to it in an accidental way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the distinction between God&amp;rsquo;s work and that of the devil is thereby designated in the clearest way, because the devil can create no substance, but can only, in an accidental way, by the providence of God [God permitting], corrupt the substance created by God.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>XII. Other Sects</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/confessions/formula/solid-declaration/other-sects/</link>

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;text-lg&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Which Never Embraced the Augsburg Confession.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, as regards the sects and factions [sectarists and heretics] which never have embraced the Augsburg Confession, and of which express mention has not been made in this our explanation, such as are the Anabaptists, Schwenckfeldians, New Arians, and Anti-Trinitarians, whose errors have been unanimously condemned by all churches of the Augsburg Confession, we have not wished to make particular and especial mention of them in this explanation, for the reason that at the present time this has been our only aim [that we might above all refute the charges of our adversaries, the Papists].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since our opponents alleged with shameless mouths, and decried throughout all the world our churches and their teachers, claiming that not two preachers are found who agree in each and every article of the Augsburg Confession, but that they are rent asunder and separated from one another to such an extent that they themselves no longer know what is the Augsburg Confession and its proper [true, genuine, and germane] sense; we have not made a joint confession only in brief words or names, but wished to make a pure, clear, distinct declaration concerning all the disputed articles which have been discussed and controverted only among the theologians of the Augsburg Confession, in order that every one may see that we do not wish in a cunning manner to dissemble or cover up all this, or to come to an agreement only in appearance; but to remedy the matter thoroughly, and have wished to set forth our opinion of these matters in such a manner that even our adversaries themselves must confess that in all this we abide by the true, simple, natural, and proper sense of the Augsburg Confession, in which we desire, moreover, by God&amp;rsquo;s grace, to persevere constantly until our end; and so far as it depends on our service, we will not connive at or be silent, lest anything contrary to the same [the genuine and sacred sense of the Augsburg Confession] is introduced into our churches and schools, in which the almighty God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ has appointed us teachers and pastors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, lest there be silently ascribed to us the condemned errors of the above enumerated factions and sects [&amp;ldquo;of which evil the papistic tyranny, which persecutes the pure doctrine is the chief cause&amp;rdquo;], -which as is the nature of such spirits, for the most part, secretly stole in at localities, and especially at a time when no place or room was given to the pure Word of the holy Gospel, but all its sincere teachers and confessors were persecuted, and the deep darkness of the Papacy still prevailed, and poor simple men who could not help but feel the manifest idolatry and false faith of the Papacy, in their simplicity, alas! embraced whatever was called the Gospel, and was not papistic,-we could not forbear testifying also against them publicly, before all Christendom, that we have neither part nor fellowship with their errors, be they many or few, but reject and condemn them, one and all, as wrong and heretical, and contrary to the Scriptures of the prophets and apostles, and to our Christian Augsburg Confession, well grounded in God&amp;rsquo;s Word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Erroneous Articles of the Anabaptists.&lt;span class=&#34;hx:absolute hx:-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;erroneous-articles-of-the-anabaptists&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#erroneous-articles-of-the-anabaptists&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Namely, for instance, the erroneous, heretical doctrines of the Anabaptists, which are to be tolerated and allowed neither in the Church, nor in the commonwealth, nor in domestic life, when they teach:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That our righteousness before God consists not only in the sole obedience and merit of Christ, but in our renewal and our own piety in which we walk before God; which they, for the most part, base upon their own peculiar ordinances and self-chosen spirituality, as upon a new sort of monkery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That children who are not baptized are not sinners before God, but righteous and innocent, and thus are saved in their innocency without Baptism, which they do not need. Accordingly, they deny and reject the entire doctrine concerning original sin and what belongs to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That children are not to be baptized until they have attained the use of reason and can confess their faith themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That the children of Christians, since they have been born of Christian and believing parents, are holy and the children of God even without and before Baptism; and for this reason they neither attach much importance to the baptism of children nor encourage it, contrary to the express words of the promise, which extends only to those who keep God&amp;rsquo;s covenant and do not despise it, Gen. 17:9.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That a congregation [church] in which sinners are still found is no true Christian assembly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That no sermon should be heard or attended in those churches in which the papal masses have previously been said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That no one should have anything to do with those ministers of the Church who preach the holy Gospel according to the Confession, and rebuke the errors of baptists; also, that no one should serve or in any way labor for them, but should flee from and shun them as perverters of God&amp;rsquo;s Word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That under the New Testament the magistracy is not a godly estate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That a Christian cannot with a good, inviolate conscience hold the office of magistrate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That a Christian cannot without injury to conscience use the office of the magistracy in matters that may occur [when the matter so demands] against the wicked, neither can its subjects appeal to its power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That a Christian cannot with a good conscience take an oath before a court, nor with an oath do homage to his prince or hereditary sovereign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That magistrates cannot without injury to conscience inflict capital punishment upon evil-doers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That a Christian cannot with a good conscience hold or possess any property, but is in duty bound to devote it to the common treasury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That a Christian cannot with a good conscience be an inn-keeper, merchant, or cutler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That married persons may be divorced on account of faith [diversity of religion], and that the one may abandon the other, and be married to another of his own faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That Christ did not assume His flesh and blood of the Virgin Mary, but brought them with Him from heaven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That He is not true, essential God either, but only has more and higher gifts and glory than other men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And still more articles of like kind; for they are divided among themselves into many bands [sects], and one has more and another fewer errors, and thus their entire sect is in reality nothing but a new kind of monkery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Erroneous Articles of the Schwenckfeldians.&lt;span class=&#34;hx:absolute hx:-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;erroneous-articles-of-the-schwenckfeldians&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#erroneous-articles-of-the-schwenckfeldians&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Likewise, when the Schwenckfeldians assert:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, that all those have no knowledge of the reigning King of heaven, Christ, who regard Christ according to the flesh, or His assumed humanity, as a creature, and that the flesh of Christ has by exaltation so assumed all divine properties that in might, power, majesty, and glory He is in every respect, in degree and position of essence, equal to the Father and the eternal Word, so that there is the same essence, properties, will, and glory of both natures in Christ, and that the flesh of Christ belongs to the essence of the Holy Trinity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That the ministry of the Church, the Word preached and heard, is not a means whereby God the Holy Ghost teaches men, and works in them saving knowledge of Christ, conversion, repentance, faith, and new obedience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That the water of Baptism is not a means by which God the Lord seals adoption and works regeneration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That bread and wine in the Holy Supper are not means by which Christ distributes His body and blood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That a Christian man who is truly regenerated by God&amp;rsquo;s Spirit can in this life keep and fulfil the Law of God perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That a congregation in which no public excommunication or regular process of the ban is observed, is no true Christian congregation [church].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That the minister of the Church who is not on his part truly renewed, righteous, and godly cannot teach other men with profit or administer real, true sacraments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Erroneous Articles of the New Arians.&lt;span class=&#34;hx:absolute hx:-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;erroneous-articles-of-the-new-arians&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#erroneous-articles-of-the-new-arians&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, when the New Arians teach that Christ is not a true, essential, natural God, of one eternal divine essence with God the Father, but is only adorned with divine majesty inferior to, and beside, God the Father.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Erroneous Articles of the New Anti-Trinitarians.&lt;span class=&#34;hx:absolute hx:-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;erroneous-articles-of-the-new-anti-trinitarians&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#erroneous-articles-of-the-new-anti-trinitarians&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, when some Anti-Trinitarians reject and condemn the ancient approved symbola, Nicaenum et Athanasianum (the Nicene and Athanasian creeds), as regards both their sense and words, and teach that there is not only one eternal divine essence of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, but as there are three distinct persons, God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, so each person has also its essence distinct and separate from the other persons; yet that all three are either as otherwise three men, distinct and separate in their essence, of the same power, wisdom, majesty, and glory [as some imagine], or in essence and properties unequal [as others think].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That the Father alone is true God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These and like articles, one and all, with what pertains to them and follows from them, we reject and condemn as wrong, false, heretical, and contrary to the Word of God, the three Creeds, the Augsburg, Confession and Apology, the Smalcald Articles, and the Catechisms of Luther. Of these articles all godly Christians should and ought to beware, as much as the welfare and salvation of their souls is dear to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since now, in the sight of God and of all Christendom [the entire Church of Christ], we wish to testify to those now living and those who shall come after us that this declaration herewith presented concerning all the controverted articles aforementioned and explained, and no other, is our faith, doctrine, and confession, in which we are also willing, by God&amp;rsquo;s grace, to appear with intrepid hearts before the judgment-seat of Jesus Christ, and give an account of it; and that we will neither privately nor publicly speak or write anything contrary to it, but, by the help of God&amp;rsquo;s grace, intend to abide thereby: therefore, after mature deliberation, we have, in God&amp;rsquo;s fear and with the invocation of His name, attached our signatures with our own hands.&lt;/p&gt;
